Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbed wire, spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
King in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack n' Jim were a few good men
Where you learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue

(Jason Aldean, Dirt Road Anthem)
